    <h1>Qintel QWatch App for Splunk SOAR</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Qintel's QWatch system contains credentials obtained from dump sites, hacker collaboratives, and command
      and control infrastructures of eCrime- and APT-related malware. With this integration, users can fetch
      exposure alerts as events and discover exposed credentials associated with their organization.
